# Welcome to my Tech repository!

This is a repository for my school course called "Blok Tech". This course is given in the sophomore-year of the study Communication & Mutlimedia Design at "Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences" also known as "De Hogeschool van Amsterdam".

The course is split in two parts, the first part of the course is the individual part and the second part of the course is where I'd have to work together in a team with other students. This repository is mainly meant for the first part of the course.

# License

I'm using the GNU General Public License v3.0 so please keep this in mind if you'd like to use my code.

# Dish Exchange

For this course, I'm meant to make a feature of my own matching application. My matching application is called "Dish Exchange". Conceptually it's an app in which users can sign themselves up for and they can add their own dishes to their accounts, they would like to trade with others. You can then match with other people's dishes, contact them and talk about the dish exchange that will possibly take place. You are also able to set preferences.

## The feature I will make

For this course, I'm not meant to make the entire app, because we would need a lot more time for that than we currently have, so the assignment is to make one of the features in my concept.

The feature I will make is being able to add dishes to your menu, display them and being able to see the detail page of a dish. If I were to have more time left, I would also like to work on being able to edit the dish you created.

# How do you use my application?

To be able to use my application you will need a few things:

- Git
- Node
- Npm
- Code editor
- Linux (either as operating system or subsystem to be able to install the packages A code editor or linux you will need in order to be able to use my application).
- Terminal for Linux

## Installation

1. Open Linux in the terminal and be in a folder where you want my application to be in
2. Find the link of my repository - You can find the link on top of my repo where it says `code` and you can copy it with the copy icon
3. Type `git clone [LINK OF MY REPOSITORY]` and insert the link of my repo in `[LINK OF MY REPOSITORY]`
4. Type `npm install` to install all dependencies of my application
5. Type `npm run dev` which will run nodemon
6. Type `localhost:3000` as an URL in the browser
7. Enjoy my application ðŸ˜Š

(I think I'm missing something about putting your information in a .env (sample) file so you can actually use the application)
